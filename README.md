# Single-Image-Depth-Estimation
Implementation of Algorithms for estimating the defocus map from a single defocused image source using image processing techniques and mathematical modelling done as team course project for the course Digital Image Processing. Uses algorithms presented in papers :-
 
 1. [Defocus map estimation from a single image via spectrum contrast](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-38-10-1706)
 2. [Defocus map estimation from a single image
