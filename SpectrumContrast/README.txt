% This package contains the algorithm implementation described in the paper:

% Running platform: Windows 7.0(64bit), Matlab 2010 (64bit).

% Usage of this code is free for research goals only.
% Please cite our paper if the code is useful.

PS: The defocus matting process need relative relatively bigger RAM space of your computer,
so we strongly recommend users to use a 64bit version Matlab intalled on a 64bit system.
